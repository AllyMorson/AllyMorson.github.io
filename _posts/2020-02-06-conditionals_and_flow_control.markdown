As humans, we  enact flow control every day. Conditionals & control flow allows us to tell our  program what code to execute conditionally.  For instance, if you are tired, you will go and take a nap. Otherwise, you'll stay up and play games or go to the gym.

Control flow is an important part of Ruby programming and web development. An example of flow control can be viewed below: 

```
if some_variable.is_a?(String)
    # do some code if some_variable is a string
else
    # this code will not run unless the variable is NOT a String
end
```
