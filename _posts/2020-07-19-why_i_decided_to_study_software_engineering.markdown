Everyday emerging technologies change the way we interact and navigate in the world. Technology touches every aspect of our lives from games and music to healthcare and finance. As a Senior Analyst with over 6 years of experience in FinTech at Fortune 100 firms and working cross functionally with Engineering and Design teams, my curiosity for programming grew and I enrolled in Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Software Engineering Program. In my 24-week cohort I will concentrate on learning programming skills such as Ruby on Rails, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL through structured assessments and an instructor led curriculum. Ultimately, these skills will allow me to gain a deeper understanding of the programming knowledge necessary to build high quality products for consumers.
