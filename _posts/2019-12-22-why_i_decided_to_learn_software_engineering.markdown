Everyday emerging technologies change the way we interact and navigate in the world. Technology touches every aspect of our lives from games and music to healthcare and finance.  As a Senior Analyst with over 6 years of experience in FinTech at Fortune 100 firms and working cross functionally with Engineering and Design teams,  my curiosity for programming grew and I enrolled in Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Software Engineering Program. In my 24-week cohort I will concentrate on learning programming skills such as Ruby on Rails, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL through structured assessments and an instructor led curriculum. Ultimately, these skills will allow me to gain a deeper understanding of the programming knowledge necessary to build high quality products for consumers. 

As a Caribbean American woman, my career experiences have shown me that there is an underrepresented number of women in this industry.  I hope to further utilize the knowledge I obtain on my journey by creating digital products for young women of color in underprivileged areas, specifically focused on mental health and wellness.  I believe immersing myself in a structered Software Engineering program will give me the necessary skills to enhance user experiences, program first class digital products and inspire other young women who look like me to accomplish great things through technology.
